# Datastore

Docker container for the ESRI ArcGIS Enterprise Data Store

I don't have a license for the temporal data.

## Build 

    docker build -t husadevops/datastore .

# tagging it to husadevops/datastore

## Web access port

HTTPSweb management: port 2443

## Data store ports

Relational data store: port 9876.

Tile cache data stores: ports 29080 and 29081.

Spatiotemporal big data stores: ports 9220 and 9320.

## Content directory

/home/arcgis/datastore/usr/arcgisdatastore

## Data store types

*Relational* Required data store type for ArcGIS Enterprise, used by
hosted feature layers, spatial analysis tools, and Insights
for ArcGIS

*Tile Cache* Stores tile caches for hosted scene layers

*Spatiotemporal* Archives real-time data for GeoEvent Server, and stores
output from GeoAnalytics Server tools

## Connection problem?

On my first attempt to connect to the server I got this error:
"Attempt to configure data store failed.. Extended error message: The
specified GIS Server site already has a managed data store."
 
I had to open the ArcGIS Server Manager (on port 6443) go to "Site"
tab select "Data Store" in the sidebar and select and delete the data
store there

## Backends

Datastore includes Postgresql

From Desktop run the Create Spatial Type tool

From ArcCatalog you can create a connection to a PostgreSQL database,
then you can "Enable Enterprise Geodatabase". This will ask for an authorization file.
It's looking for a keycodes file, not a PRVC file.
